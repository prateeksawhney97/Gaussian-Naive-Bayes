# Gaussian-Naive-Bayes

### Importing a Random Dataset using sklearn.datasets and fixing the no. of samples to be 200 and the number of features to be 2. Performing a classification task using Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier and training the model using fit() function as:

### gnb = GaussianNB()
### gnb.fit(X,Y)

### Calculating the accuracy using gnb.score(X,Y) method which comes out to be 0.915
